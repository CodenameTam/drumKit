This app is a simple interactive drum kit that utilizes JavaScript’s event listeners to trigger a response from what the user presses or clicks. Overall, with learning Vanilla Javascript, this projects displays functionality that can be added to even a very basic site.

## Overview 

This was a bootcamp project that helped me understand how to use the query selector that connects to the HTML document to alter them. Also, custom sound files were implemented within the Javascript file that allowed the sound effects:

```
New Audio();
	.play();
```

## Instructions

Press or click each instrument button to play or interact with it.

## What I Learned

The `switch` function was a very new concept that enabled multifunctional controls without reloading the entire page.

Within the Javascript file are my notes from building the project to further help me understand what the code was doing by segment.
I did however manage to customize the buttons and give the project personalized colors.

## Current Challenges

Within Javascript the arguments or parameters that are passed in a function is where my mind will need time to understand this part of Javascript. However, I am able to observe code and eventually understand what part of the code connects to the other. With that being said, I will continue learning Javascript from the fundamentals in order to continue my development journey!

Enjoy!
